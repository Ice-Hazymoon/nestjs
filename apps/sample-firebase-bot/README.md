# sample-firebase-bot

This Nx Firebase application was generated by [@simondotm/nx-firebase](https://github.com/simondotm/nx-firebase).

## Introduction

This demo project is a proof-of-concept Firebase Function bot implementation. It utilizes webhooks linked to Firebase functions to implement process the postbacks.

- Currently, only local development is tested (using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for webhooks)
- Two functions implemented:
  - `/webhook`: The webhook postback
  - `/command`: A command interface that can be control Firebase via a NestJS controller. Not sure if this is needed, but it's available as an out-of-band communication tool with your project

## Setup

- Setup your Firebase project as normal and configure your `./firebaserc` file with the project_id
  - `firebase login` - Authenticate the Firebase CLI
  - `firebase use --add` - Add your Firebase Project as a target to `.firebaserc`
- Create a free [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com) and set `NGROK_TOKEN` in your environment
- Configure `~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml` as per the example below
- Copy `packages/sample-firebase-bot/src/.env.example` to `packages/sample-firebase-bot/src/.env` and configure with your values

> :information_source: **Required Environment Variables** Ensure these environment variables are set

- `NGROK_TOKEN`
- `BOT_TOKEN`

> :warning: **Firebase Emulation Only** You may need to link `@grammyjs/nestjs` to this project. For example:

```sh
nx run grammy-nestjs:build
pushd dist/packages/grammy-nestjs/
yarn link
popd
yarn link @grammyjs/nestjs
```

## Commands

To start/stop your webhook:

```sh
./packages/sample-firebase-bot/ngrok.sh start
#or
./packages/sample-firebase-bot/ngrok.sh stop
#or
./packages/sample-firebase-bot/ngrok.sh status
```

To start the emulator, running your bot locally:

```sh
yarn nx run sample-firebase-bot:emulate
```

The `packages/sample-firebase-bot/ngrok.sh` script is called prior to starting. This command:

- Retrieves the currently active `ngrok` tunnel and posts it to Telegram for your bot

## `~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml`

```yaml
authtoken: xxxxxx
tunnels:
  grammy:
    proto: http
    addr: 5001
```

## `.firebaserc`

```yaml
{ "projects": { "default": "abcd...." } }
```
